Arduino Bus Arbitrator Library

Written by Radu - Eosif Mihailescu <radu.mihailescu@linux360.ro> 2012-07-12

This library is for when you have multiple devices connected to the SPI bus,
presumably using different speeds and/or signalling modes and want to make sure
they won't step on their toes.

To the furthest extent that this is legally possible, the fork maintained by 
Radu - Eosif Mihailescu and published here https://github.com/csdexter/Arbitrator
is hereby released under the LGPL version 3.
To the furthest extent that this is legally enforceable, the copyright remains
with the authors listed above.

See the example sketches to learn how to use the library in your code.

NOTES:
 * Connect all SPI devices in parallel. Daisy chain connection is obviously
   possible only for (groups of) devices that share the same signalling
   parameters. Please note SS (selection) management is out of the scope of this
   library.
 * Define the bus topology (each client's configuration) and call begin().
 * Notify each [software] client of their client index in the topology array.
 * Specify your client index when calling the arbitrator from your [software]
   client.

maintainer at <radu.mihailescu@linux360.ro>.
